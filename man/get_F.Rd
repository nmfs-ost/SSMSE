\item{fleetnames}{A vector of fleet names, in the order they appear in the
SS3 model.}

and fleet; F_rate, a data frame with F for the time frame of the model
only by year, Seas, and fleet, ordered as the ss.par file expects; init_F,
a named vector of initial F values by Season and fleet, ordered (and named)
